# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to house the results of testing additional features for the PlanMyTrip app.  Specifically, we added the following:

- The weather description to the weather data already retrieved for the app

- Input statements for beta testers to enter their ideal minimum and maximum tempteratures in order to find potential travel destinations

- An itinerary based on four of the cities from the potential travel destinations as well as a travel route.
